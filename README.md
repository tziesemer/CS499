| [Enhancement 1](https://github.com/tziesemer/CS499/tree/enhancement1)   | Took python project from CS 340 and turned it into a MERN fullstack javascript project        | Software Design and Engineering |
| [Enhancement 2](https://github.com/tziesemer/CS499/tree/enhancement1)   | Added a filter that took already loaded data and filtered it appropriatly to lessen API calls | Algorithms and Data Structures  |
| [Enhancement 3](https://github.com/tziesemer/CS499/tree/enhancement3)   | Added full CRUD operations, a login, and seperated the API from the main code                 | Databases                       |


## Code Review
The code review was done first of course and as such is not 100% accurate to the outcome of these enhancements. Of note enhancment two ended up being a filter built to sift through the massive amount of data instead of any hash tables.
Here is the link to the [Code Review](https://github.com/tziesemer/CS499). Note that this is a youtube link and will take you out of github.

## Enhancement 1 Narrative
For all of my enhancements I used the base of my CS 340: Advanced programing concepts project as my artifact. I worked off of each previous enhnacment to create a full stack application out of it. 
The original artifact was a python program written in jupyter notebook which takes a large amount of data in mongoDB and presents it to the user as a table, map, and piechart. It also included options to filter the data for specific purposes. I created this artifact about ten months ago.

I believe this artifact was very simple when built in python with some added libraries so I knew that moving it over to javascript would show both my ability to reverse engineer how the software works and translate it to a different language but also how I can overcome the differences between those languages to give the user the same or improved experience.
